    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "In this section, you'll learn\n",
    "1. How to use various scikit-learn machine learning algorithms\n",
    "2. How to select features for a real-world machine learning problem\n",
    "3. How to design a neural network that makes predictions based on our selected features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this section, you should have an understanding of\n",
    "1. [scikit-learn and Tensorflow](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/MachineLearningWorkshopWeek1/)\n",
